# Customer-Journey-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer journeys by leveraging clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction. The goal is to segment customers based on their behavior, interactions, and engagement patterns, helping businesses gain actionable insights for personalized marketing, retention strategies, and improved customer experience.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing customer interaction data.
Dimensionality Reduction: Using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional customer behavior data into a more interpretable form.
Clustering: Applying algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
Visualization & Insights: Analyzing and visualizing clustered segments to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior patterns.
